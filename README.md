Interjekt
=========

Interjekt is an Arduino sketch that can take up to 6 PPM inputs from a Reciever, manipulate them based on sensory input, 
and transmit the modified signal via PWM to a Multirotor, Airplane, Car, or any other R/C controlled device.

It has been tested with a  Spektrum DX5e with AR6100 Reciever, Arduino Uno (running the Sketch), and Multiwii Pro Flight
Controller. It should work on any reasonable combination, however. 

It was created by Rahul Tiwari, with credits for PPM input given to 'eswink' (A currently inactive user on the Arduino Forums).
